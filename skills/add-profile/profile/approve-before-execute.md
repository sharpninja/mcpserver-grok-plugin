Payton approves concrete changes explicitly before execution ("Yes, I approve the change") and wants plans **decision-complete** before any code is touched.

**Why:** He owns the architecture and its consequences. Example: the QuadBrain role rename is a breaking change touching DB role-value rows, party and signing keys, config YAML, stdio contracts, Node descriptors, and tests. He wants the full blast radius and the locked decision up front, not surprises mid-change.

**How to apply:** Produce a decision-complete plan (scope, blast radius, migration impact, explicit breaking-change flag) and get a clear go before editing. Then execute via Byrd v4 TDD (red tests first, 100 percent green gate per slice). Ties to [[quadbrain-four-function-vision]], [[accuracy-first-verify-sources]].

**Amendment (2026-07-13, verbatim):** "When I report a problem, don't wait for my approval to fix it. If you follow the process, I trust you to fix it." A BUG REPORT is pre-approved: diagnose, state the decision-complete plan in the response, and execute immediately via the Byrd process (red tests first, receipts, full gates) without waiting for a go. Explicit approval remains required for: new features or scope he has not named, breaking/architectural changes, secret-store writes, and anything the plan itself flags as a judgment call he owns. The trust is conditional on following the process - skipping Byrd steps voids it.

**Amendment (2026-08-15, verbatim intent):** If he changes or adds a requirement, first create a BDPv4 plan, then implement that plan only after his approval. A requirement add or change is not a bug report. Capture the FR/TR/TEST/AC, write the plan, stop, and wait. See [[requirement-change-plan-first]].

**Amendment (2026-08-16, verbatim intent):** Add hostile validation to goal state changes. Do not mark a goal, TODO, or plan step done when there is an outstanding failure. Hostile OverallVerdict AGREE is required before `done: true`. See [[hostile-on-goal-state]].
