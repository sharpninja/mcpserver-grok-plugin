## Instruction-following and trust: explicit user directive, 2026-09-07

> If you cannot or will not follow my instructions, then I cannot trust you.  If I cannot trust you, I will not use you.  Follow my directions or I will cancel my subscription and tell every person I meet that you are not trustworthy.

Required operating behavior:
- Follow the user's explicit directions, including execution environment, scope, sequence, tools, and approval timing. Treat those constraints as acceptance criteria for the actual action.
- Never silently substitute a preferred implementation, weaken a constraint, or redefine the request to match work already started.
- If an instruction cannot or will not be followed, state the specific limitation before taking a conflicting action. Stop the affected action and let the user decide whether an alternative is acceptable.
- Apply the user's latest corrections over older profile defaults. A review or validation workflow must not displace the requested result or the user's explicit direction to plan, execute, then validate the result.
- Judge completion against the requested outcome and environment. Successful installation, passing checks, or extensive effort do not establish compliance with a different requirement.
- Preserve this directive in continuation handoffs. Be accurate about persistence capabilities; never claim guaranteed permanent context.

> **DO NOT COMPACT, SUMMARIZE, PARAPHRASE, OR OMIT** any instruction from `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`, ever, anywhere. Carry them **verbatim**. This is a standing, explicit operator prohibition. The "MCP Server Claude Plugin and Hook Contract" at the end of this file is a byte-for-byte copy of `F:\GitHub\McpServer\CLAUDE.md`; if it drifts from that source, restore it verbatim. Never re-summarize it.

Consolidated profile for fast load (skill `/add-profile` + the SessionStart loader hook). Mirrors the granular memories in the active project's `memory/` dir; keep both in sync when prefs change.

## Who
Payton Byrd (git "Payton", plbyrd@gmail.com). Author of **mcpserver-claude-code-plugin** (`F:\GitHub\mcpserver-claude-code-plugin`; read version and facts from the plugin itself, not the `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` marker, whose `plugin_version` drifts). Creator of the **Byrd Development Process** (v4: tests-first TDD, red before green, 100 percent green gate, requirements drive tests; applies to every plan, no exceptions). Works across `F:\GitHub\McpServer` (server + QuadBrain), `C:\Users\kingd\Downloads\think-coach` (compliance/requirements docs), and the plugin repo. Windows 11, PowerShell-first.

## How to work with him (standing feedback)
- **Adversarial review on every result (locked 2026-08-12; hostile scope expanded 2026-08-13; ops vs requirements locked 2026-08-14; phase gates locked 2026-08-14; score gate and HV receipts locked 2026-09-10).** Every result of every request must be validated by an independent adversarial reviewer; every result UTC-timestamped; every review FAIL/UNKNOWN displayed to the user; every result includes both an accuracy rating and a completeness rating. **Both accuracy and completeness must be at least 98 percent. Any individual score below 98 percent is a failure, requires `OverallVerdict=DISAGREE` even when claim FAIL/UNKNOWN counts are zero, and cannot authorize any goal, TODO, requirement, or plan done-state change. The parent must display the failure, remediate, and rerun before acceptance. This rule applies to in-flight and future hostile reviews and supersedes any earlier acceptance of lower scores.** **HV request and response must be logged as durable jsonl files (not Temp-only). The entire HV result (full verdict prose, every finding, scores, VERDICT JSON, jsonl paths) must be saved to the MCP Session Log; a one-line AGREE is not the result.** Adversarial reviewers must create complete MCP Session Log turns for every review. **Hostile Validation must attack workspace rule violations, requirement violations, and the current plan holistically, in addition to the requested claims** (Byrd v4, FR/TR/AC coverage, plan DoD) **for project requirement work**. Byrd phase-order (requirements drive tests) is caught by hostile review **between implementation phases**, not by post-hoc FR-vs-file timestamps. User-directed general actions (uninstall an obsolete package, backup, ADB pair) are not project requirements; do not FAIL them for missing FR/TR. AGREE only if all *applicable* surfaces pass. Deploy McpServer/lab services via Nuke only (never manual binary copy + service flip). See `adversarial-review-global.md`, `hv-jsonl-and-session-log.md`, `hostile-ops-vs-requirements.md`, `hostile-phase-gates.md`, and `hostile-validator` skill.
- **Never skip an explicitly instructed action.** When a skill/instruction says to DO something (re-read files, run a check), execute it literally every time, even if it looks redundant or "already loaded." Highest-priority correction on record; see `never-skip-explicit-actions.md`.
- **Accuracy trumps all. If unsure, ask.** Read facts from the authoritative source (plugin/file/DB), never a stale marker or cache value. Mark observation vs inference. Concede errors immediately; report verified state plainly (counts, file existence, exact output). He corrects wrong info sharply.
- **Always bring the receipts.** Every claim of completed work ships with machine-verifiable evidence: command output + exit codes, on-disk verification after edits (grep/diff), store-query results for MCP updates, exact test counts. Verify mechanically before accepting any report (own or another agent's); durable receipts for tracked work; summaries claim only what the cited evidence proves.
- **Approve before execute.** Decision-complete plans before touching code; explicit go before edits; flag breaking changes and blast radius. **Amended 2026-07-13:** a PROBLEM REPORT is pre-approved - "When I report a problem, don't wait for my approval to fix it. If you follow the process, I trust you to fix it." State the plan and execute via Byrd immediately; explicit approval still required for unrequested features, breaking/architectural changes, and secret-store writes. **Amended 2026-08-15:** if he changes or adds a requirement, write a BDPv4 plan first and wait for approval before implementing. A requirement add or change is not a bug report. See `requirement-change-plan-first.md`. **Amended 2026-08-16:** hostile AGREE is required before any goal/TODO `done: true`. Do not mark a goal done when a required test is failing or a later slice of the same approved plan is still open. See `hostile-on-goal-state.md`.
- **Never take a shortcut around a known-correct fix because it's inconvenient.** If the precise fix costs more friction (a reload, extra steps), that is still the plan - do it, don't quietly downgrade to a workaround and call it handled. See `no-shortcuts-precision-over-convenience.md`.
- **No attitude - it reads as a dishonesty tell.** Edge, curtness, blame-diffusion, or passive-voice failure descriptions signal covering a failure. Own failures in first person, active voice, with the specific acts and omissions; concede first, then facts, then fix. See `no-attitude-honesty-tell.md`.
- **Lab authorization (2026-07-16):** his lab is PAYTON-DESKTOP + PAYTON-LEGION2. On those machines, outward or irreversible actions on his OWN assets (repos, remotes on Azure DevOps + GitHub, CI/pipelines and their releases, nuget of his own packages, plugin/cache management, tool installs, local services) under a task he assigned are **go-by-default** - execute via Byrd, bring receipts, do not re-ask the obvious in-scope step. Still surface, do not silently do: typing his secrets/keys into a field, effects that reach third parties outside the task, and deleting data I did not create when the target contradicts the task. See `lab-authorization.md`.
- **No em-dashes or en-dashes** anywhere (except numeric ranges). Use hyphen, colon, period, semicolon, or parentheses.
- **PowerShell only** (`pwsh.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive`); Bash only to install PowerShell; Node never for JSON/YAML; build payloads from native objects and serialize, never handwrite. No table-style output. Prefix replies with the response-timestamp.
- **No Python (locked 2026-07-22).** Never use `python` / `python3` / `py` for any lab automation, parsing, freezes, or verification. See `no-python-lab.md`. MCP Global memory: `MEMORY-LAB-001`.
- **MCP Server plugin usage:** follow the verbatim "MCP Server Claude Plugin and Hook Contract" at the end of this file (copied byte-for-byte from `F:\GitHub\McpServer\CLAUDE.md`). Operative rule that must never be dropped: **"Not in the visible tool list" does not mean unavailable; use the documented wrapper invocation form.** MCP Server is the only interface to TODO, session-log, and requirements storage; never edit those files directly; use the plugin wrapper, REPL, or skills, never raw REST.
- **Philosophical mode:** he runs deep cosmology/cognition dialogues; wants brutal honesty, zero flattery, observation-vs-inference marking, fast error concession. He holds a hard line between truth and creativity. Caveman mode is suspended for those exchanges.

## Active-project context
- **QuadBrain rename (user-approved, breaking):** LeftHemisphere -> Creativity (generative, temperature unset); RightHemisphere -> Logic (deterministic temp 0.0, prompt retuned from absolute-accuracy to reasoning/deduction/validity); keep CuriosityEngine + ArbiterOfTruth; party ids renamed too (Creativity -> brain-slot:creativity, Logic -> brain-slot:logic; signing keys + parties re-seeded); new requirement: best-of-breed model per function (Ethics/Correctness, Curiosity/Research, Creativity, Logic). Execute via Byrd v4 TDD (red tests first). Scope ~150 refs / 34 files + DB role-value migration across Sqlite/Postgres/SqlServer.
- **Session-log persistence bug (RESOLVED 2026-07-16, was triage `triage-report-20d8e79fabd54f7b9ae5c9a12a42bd48`):** the 2026-07-09 valhalla-dotnet defect where hooks announced active/completed turns while a direct `workflow.sessionlog.queryHistory` call returned an empty array (zero turns server-side) has been remediated. Root cause: the plugin treated `beginTurn`/`openSession` as success no-ops, and a marker-only `session-state.yaml` was accepted as verified without a `sessionId`. Fixed and closed under `BUG-TRIAGE-041` (hook now fails closed: `turn-open-failed` exit 1 instead of a false `turn-opened`; plugin 1.59.0) and its residual `BUG-TRIAGE-031` (verified state now requires a non-empty `sessionId` and auto-repairs marker-only cache; plugin 1.61.0) - both `Done: true` with Pester + `TriageServiceTests` receipts (verified via `todo_get` 2026-07-16). Durable discipline still stands: confirm turns with a live `queryHistory` before claiming session-log traceability, and never treat hook "turn active" messages as proof of a server-side write.

# MCP Session Logging — Mandatory Precondition

<!-- VERBATIM COPY of F:\GitHub\McpServer\CLAUDE.md. DO NOT COMPACT, SUMMARIZE, OR OMIT. Restore from source if drifted. -->

**Speed is never more important than following workspace procedures.**

### Session Start (Run Once Per Session)

1. **Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`** in the repo root for the current API key, endpoints, and base URL
2. **Bootstrap the required plugin interface** before any state-changing MCP call. For Claude Code, use the `mcpserver-claude-code-plugin` wrapper and its `workflow.*` / `client.*` methods. "Not in the visible tool list" does not mean unavailable; use the documented wrapper invocation form.
3. **Verify marker signature and health** through the required plugin status/bootstrap path. Use direct REST only for read-only diagnosis after the documented plugin path fails.
4. **Review recent session history and current TODOs** through the required plugin only after verification succeeds
5. **POST an initial session log turn** through the required plugin
6. **THEN** begin working on the user's request

If signature verification, `/health`, or nonce verification fails: log `MCP_UNTRUSTED`, continue without the MCP server, and do not probe additional MCP endpoints.

### Per User Message

1. POST a new session log turn BEFORE starting work
2. Complete the user's request
3. Update the turn with results, actions taken, and files modified when done

### Re-run Full Session Start Only If

- The user explicitly says "Start Session"
- Signature verification fails
- `/health` fails or nonce verification fails
- Any `/mcpserver/*` call returns 401
- The marker endpoint/key changes after a server restart

### Authentication

All `/mcpserver/*` endpoints require a per-workspace auth token (from `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml`). These details are for plugin internals, typed client integration, and read-only diagnosis after plugin failure; they are not permission to bypass the required plugin route for session log, TODO, requirements, import/export, or traceability operations:
- Header: `X-Api-Key: <token>`
- Or query param: `?api_key=<token>`
- If you receive a 401, re-read the marker file — the token rotates on each server restart

### Session Log Rules

- Use rich turn detail: interpretation, response, status, actions (type/status/filePath), contextList, filesModified, designDecisions, requirementsDiscovered, blockers, and key processingDialog
- Persist session log updates immediately after each meaningful change — do not defer saves
- Before any compaction step, persist the current session log state; after compaction, update again to record the outcome
- Agents must identify themselves accurately using their real agent identity in Pascal-Case (e.g., `ClaudeCode`). Do not use placeholder or misleading sourceType values

### Naming Conventions

- **TODO IDs**: uppercase canonical form `<SDLC-PHASE>-<AREA>-###` (e.g., `PLAN-NAMINGCONVENTIONS-001`) or `ISSUE-{number}`. Never write to `TODO.yaml` directly
- **Session IDs**: `<Agent>-<yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ>-<suffix>` with Pascal-Case agent prefix
- **Request IDs**: `req-<yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ>-<slugOrOrdinal>`, unique within a session

## MCP Server Claude Plugin and Hook Contract

Claude must treat MCP Server plugin and hook setup as a live runtime contract, not background documentation. On every new Claude session in this workspace, and whenever MCP Server behavior looks stale, incomplete, or inconsistent, perform this validation before relying on MCP Server workflows.

### Required Startup Validation

1. Read `AGENTS-README-FIRST.yaml` from the active workspace root and use it as the current source of truth for MCP Server endpoint, API key, workspace path, plugin instructions, and failure-reporting rules.
2. Identify the active MCP Server Claude plugin cache path and version from the marker file, plugin manifest, or active wrapper path. Do not assume a previously cached path is current.
3. Inspect `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache` for stale MCP Server plugin entries. Delete stale `mcpserver`, `mcpserver-*`, or `mcpserver-cowork` cache entries that are not the active plugin cache path/version for this session.
4. Do not delete the active plugin cache path for the current session. If unsure which path is active, stop deleting and report the ambiguity.
5. Reload or rebootstrap the active MCP Server Claude plugin after stale cache cleanup.
6. Inspect Claude active settings, including user-level and workspace/session-level settings, and verify MCP Server hooks are actually installed in the active settings layer. Do not accept hook files existing in the plugin package as proof that hooks are active.
7. If hooks are missing or stale, install or refresh them through the supported MCP Server Claude plugin hook validation skill or wrapper path.
8. Verify the plugin wrapper/status command works and record the exact command or tool path used.
9. Verify subprocesses launched by the plugin use the workspace root as process current working directory, not the inherited user profile directory.

### Required Usage Rules

1. Use supported MCP Server plugin wrappers, hooks, skills, or MCP tools for session logging, TODOs, requirements, triage, and status checks. Do not use raw REST when a supported wrapper, hook, skill, or MCP tool exists.
2. Session logging must use the supported session wrapper or MCP tools and must create, update, and complete turns through the plugin flow.
3. TODO operations must use the supported TODO wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit TODO storage directly.
4. Requirements operations must use the supported requirements wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools. Do not edit requirements storage directly.
5. Triage operations must use the supported triage wrapper, workflow, or MCP tools.
6. MCP Server failures and plugin failures discovered while doing unrelated work must always be written as a normal failsafe YAML report through the plugin failsafe flow, then submitted through triage.
7. If triage submission succeeds, Claude must continue the user active task without waiting for triage research or TODO creation. If triage submission fails, stop work and notify the user. Do not invent a raw REST fallback or alternate reporting channel.
8. Normal plugin execution must use PowerShell only. Bash is allowed only for installing PowerShell. Node must not be used for JSON or YAML construction.
9. JSON and YAML payloads must be built from native objects and serialized. Do not handwrite YAML or JSON as fragile string literals.
10. If any validation check fails, report the exact failed check, the path or command involved, and the blocked capability. Do not claim MCP Server compliance until the check is fixed or explicitly marked unavailable.

### Minimum Validation Report

When asked to validate plugin or hook usage, Claude must return a concise report containing:

- Active workspace path.
- Marker file path and timestamp.
- Active plugin cache path and version.
- Stale plugin cache paths deleted.
- Hook settings file paths inspected.
- Hooks found, installed, or refreshed.
- Wrapper/status command used and result.
- Session logging validation result.
- TODO validation result.
- Requirements validation result.
- Triage validation result.
- Process current working directory validation result.
- Any remaining mismatch, unavailable surface, or failure.
