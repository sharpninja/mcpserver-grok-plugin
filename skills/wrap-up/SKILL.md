description: Close out MCP-backed Grok work when asked to "wrap up", "export requirements", or "close out".

Trust marker details only after the local status script confirms marker trust and workspace health. Use `lib/repl-invoke.sh` or `lib/repl-invoke.ps1`; do not use raw REST for normal MCP mutations.

Reconcile requirements through `workflow.requirements.*`, export wiki documents with `workflow.requirements.generateDocument`, run validation, then use the `commit-sync` pause contract for commit/push. Reconcile the session log with `workflow.sessionlog.appendDialog` and `workflow.sessionlog.appendActions`.

Complete the turn with `workflow.sessionlog.completeTurn`. Use `workflow.sessionlog.failTurn` for validation failure, export failure, or blocked commit/push.
